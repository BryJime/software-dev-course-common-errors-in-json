üè® JSON Syntax Debugging: Hotel Booking Data
===========================================

üéØ Objective:
Students will analyze a JSON file containing multiple syntax errors,
identify the issues, and correct them.

This activity helps practice spotting and fixing common JSON mistakes such as:
- Missing commas
- Incorrect use of quotation marks
- Unmatched brackets/braces
- Trailing commas
- Invalid data types

// ============================================

/*
üìò Scenario:
You‚Äôre a developer on a team building a travel booking API.

A teammate submitted a JSON file to represent a hotel booking, 
but it contains multiple syntax errors that prevent it from being parsed.

üîß Your Task:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Review the provided JSON file
2Ô∏è‚É£ Identify all syntax errors
3Ô∏è‚É£ Write down what each error is and why it causes a problem
4Ô∏è‚É£ Correct the JSON structure so that it is valid
5Ô∏è‚É£ Validate your corrected version using a JSON linter or validator

üß™ Deliverables:
- A corrected version of the JSON
- A list of the corrections made and why each was necessary
*/


// ============================================
// üîç Provided JSON File with Errors
// ============================================

const invalidBookingJSON = `
{
  "hotelName": "Grand City Hotel",
  "checkInDate": "2024-05-15", (Fixed by adding comma to individualize key)
  "checkOutDate": "2024-05-20",
  "guests": [
    {
      "name": "Alice Johnson", (Fixed by enclosing name in double quotes. All keys must have double quotes)
      "age": 30,
      "email": "alice.johnson@example.com"
    },
    {
      "name": "Bob Smith",
      "age": null, (Fixed by changing to null. Undefined is invalid)
      "email": "bob.smith@example"
    }
  ],
  "roomDetails": {
    "type": "Suite",
    "pricePerNight": 200,
    "amenities": ["WiFi", "Breakfast", "Parking"] (Fixed by taking out trailing comma)
  }
}
`;


// ============================================
// ‚úÖ Requirements
// ============================================

/*
- Use a JSON validator or linter (e.g., https://jsonlint.com/) to test your final version
- Keep track of each fix:
  ‚Ä¢ What was wrong?
  ‚Ä¢ Why is it a problem in JSON?
  ‚Ä¢ What did you change to fix it?
*/


// ============================================
// ü§î Follow-Up Questions
// ============================================

/*
üí¨ Reflect and answer the following:

1Ô∏è‚É£ What tools or techniques did you use to identify the errors?

The tools I used were VS and JSONLint. I first glanced at the json file 
for any obvious errors and corrected them, them validated them with JSONLint.

2Ô∏è‚É£ How did you confirm that your corrected JSON file was valid?

I used VS and JSONLint

3Ô∏è‚É£ Which errors were the most difficult to spot? Why?

There were not any difficult errors, though if I weren't paying attention
I would've missed the undefined error.

4Ô∏è‚É£ What strategies can help you avoid these kinds of errors in the future?
   (e.g., syntax highlighting, linters, writing JSON by example)

   Copying and pasting the JSON into an IDE with syntax highlighters would help with this.
